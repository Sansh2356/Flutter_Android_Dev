Adding of firebase dependencies will be absolutely right as it is published by an authentic source hence threr

they may differ in states as well as in other things such as 
sometimes the change may be so major that it would not be possible for hot reload to express it 
and provide the change accordingly in such cases hot restart will provide us with the desired result and changes which would be visible oon the android/Ios platform 
visible on the android mirroring and the ios platform.
